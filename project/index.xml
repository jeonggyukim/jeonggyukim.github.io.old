      <description>Almost all stars in the present-day Universe are believed to form in clusters embedded in giant molecular clouds (GMCs). It has long been known to observers that star formation in GMCs is a slow and inefficient process, in the sense that star formation rate is much more smaller than what would be expected from the free-fall (pure gravitational) collapse and that clouds turn only a small fraction of gas mass into stars during their lifetime.</description>
